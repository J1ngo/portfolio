        One great thing about working for a consulting company is that we've been able to participate in more distinct projects than most people, save those who wear jobs like coats.

        The following are some of the other projects/areas I've done work in:

        <h3>Freedom National</h3>
        <p>Freedom National (auto insurance) has a long-standing relationship with our company, and I've been contributing to their ASP.NET-based <a href="https://freedomgeneral.com" target="_blank">point-of-sale site</a> off and on for a few years now.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>LeadCloud</h3>
        <p>LeadCloud, as the name suggests, provides a way to capture auto insurance leads for sales agents. We built a website in AngularJS to capture these leads and to complete the sale.</p>
