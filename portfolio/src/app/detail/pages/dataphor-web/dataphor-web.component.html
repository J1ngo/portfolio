<h1 style="color: #F44336;">Dataphor Web Client</h1>

    <p>
        In keeping Dataphor modern and in line with industry expectations, we've decided to build an Angular 2 client to run our applications sans the complexity that comes with local installations.
        <em>I am currently building this</em>.

        Unless you get around the web far too much, you probably don't know what Dataphor is––I could point you to <a href="http://dataphor.org/MainPage.ashx" target="_blank">their site</a>, but I'll summarize it here to save you the trip.
        Dataphor is a platform that can take data from different databases and build forms based on their structure and typings.
        There's also an accompanying client called Dataphoria, which allows you to make your own forms and to modify the auto-generated forms, in addition to writing scripts.
        Some of the principal creators (including my current boss) of this would likely balk at my definition here, but I think it does a reasonable job explaining the gist of what Dataphor is.

        As for what it does, it allows you to build complex form-based applications with very little effort, once everything is set up properly. This has been manifest in the enterprise projects that run on Dataphor (including a set of medical clinics running Allscripts).
