    <p><a href="nanostring.com" target="_blank">Nanostring</a> provides instruments and services for biological research, including immuno-oncology and (soon) neuroscience. I'm currently working on the R&amp;D team with them to develop their new Digital Spacial Profiler (DSP) device, which images targeted cell samples in ultra-high definition.</p>
    <p>As it is an unreleased product, for visuals, I'll have to point you to their website for it: <a href="https://www.nanostring.com/scientific-content/technology-overview/digital-spatial-profiling-technology" target="_blank">https://www.nanostring.com/scientific-content/technology-overview/digital-spatial-profiling-technology.</a></p>
    <p>My role thus far has been to develop the UI and its services as a senior software engineer with generous experience in the tech they are using right now (Angular 5.x, Polymer, CSS, .NET CORE, POSTGRES). And fortunately for me, there's plenty of design detail to be filled as we develop the services.</p>
