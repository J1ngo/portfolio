    <p><a href="nanostring.com" target="_blank">Nanostring</a> provides instruments and services for biological research, including immuno-oncology and (soon) neuroscience. I'm currently working on the R&amp;D team with them to develop their new Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) device, which images targeted cell samples in ultra-high definition and provides multiplexed analysis of said samples.</p>
    <p>As it is an unreleased final product, I actually can't share screenshots for visuals. The most I can do is point you to their website for the product: <a href="https://www.nanostring.com/scientific-content/technology-overview/digital-spatial-profiling-technology" target="_blank">https://www.nanostring.com/scientific-content/technology-overview/digital-spatial-profiling-technology.</a></p>
    <p>As a senior engineer, my role has been to develop the web application and its corresponding services and databases.</p>
    <p>Specifically, we've built the web app in Angular 6.x, the services in .NET core 2.0, the database in Postgres, all of this running in a tangled web of isolated Docker containers.</p>
