    <p>Well met!</p>
    <p>I am a UX Engineer by title and other things in practice. I received an BS in Computer Science (minor in Physics) and began my career in Software Engineering. During these years (and presently), I built a wide range of products, from enterprise to small-scale ventures. While engineering these systems, my personal interests pulled me into the realm of applied psychology–User Experience. In tandem with developing my skills as a Software Engineer, I've honed my design and research skills and have augmented typical software engineering with human cognition, reconciling product vision  with real-world constraints.</p>
    <p>I am experienced in software engineering, design, applied psychology, writing, and research.</p>
    <p>My zeal lies in the realm of Cognitive Neuroscience and how it maps (or doesn't!) to Artificial Intelligence––and I intend to pursue his PhD in that area (or something highly related). The medical product world in which I find myself has yet to fully explore and harmonize itself with CNS and AI, but we'll do what we can to keep the ball (of inexorable progress) rolling.</p>
    <p>Less professionally but with equal ardor, I'm a writer. And what do I write? At this point, it's mostly philosophical, but I'm covering CNS and AI. I'm also hoping to cut my teeth on long-form science fiction at some point (feel free to ask me about <a href="https://youtu.be/NTSGp4UdEvQ" target="_blank">that novel I've been working on</a>).</p>
