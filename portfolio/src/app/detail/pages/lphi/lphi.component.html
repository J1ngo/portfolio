<article>
    <p>As part of our first all-hands-on deck endeavor (since the merger), HarmonIQ's Salt Lake and Louisiana divisions are currently working on a large-scale project for hospitals in Louisiana.</p>
    <p>The project is large in scope, but the initial impetus for is was a need to archive terabytes of patient health records from several different health systems. Of course, it's not enough to simply throw all your data on a capacious server and call it a dayâ€“you also need to manage, retrieve, update, validate, and merge the data.</p>
    <p>So far, my work on the project has been to build the frontend for clinical admins to merge patient records that our algorithms have determined have a high likelihood of describing the same patient. We succeeded in building that tool.</p>
    <p>(I believe I can show this much.)</p>

    <p>The next step is to build a separate tool for managing patient information disclosure consent. We're designing and building a site for the resulting workflow.</p>
